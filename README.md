# UKPeatlandMicrobes
# Welcome
This repository contains all scripts and data tables used in the analysis of microbial communities from total metagenomes generated from upland peatland soils in the UK, as described in Pallier et al.

The original raw sequence reads are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject accession PRJNA1203648. Prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are accessible through NCBI WGA under the same accession.

# Repository Organization
Scripts include R and shell scripts used to perform the analyses and run the tools described in the bioinformatic workflow.

Tables contain data tables in .csv and .tsv formats, used in the analyses to produce the data files found in the Data directory. This folder also includes organized and summarized data that were used in the Supplementary Tables.

Plots include the saved figures in PNG format.
